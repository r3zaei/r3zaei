I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering & Computer Science at California State University, Long Beach and the director of [CARS-Lab](https://aminrezaei.com/en/cars-lab). I got my PhD in Computer Engineering from Northwestern University. I have a dozen years of experience in hardware security, computer architecture, and machine learning and have published 40 peer-reviewed scientific articles at flagship venues such as DAC, ICCAD, DATE, and ASP-DAC.

I have served on the technical program committees and as session chair of major design automation conferences, including IPDPS, ICCAD, ASP-DAC, ICCD, GLSVLSI, AsianHOST, ISQED, and PAINE. Furthermore, NSF has funded two of my grant proposals totaling half a million dollars towards CISE-MSI and CRII programs. I am also the recipient of Academic Excellence Award from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and Walter P. Murphy and Royal E. Cabell Fellowship awards from Northwestern University.
